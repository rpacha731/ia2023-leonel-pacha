## Repository for artificial intelligence / ia2023-leonel-pacha
This repository contains the code for the practical experiences of the course IA2023 - Artificial Intelligence, taught at the Aeronautics University Institute (IUA) in the second semester of 2023.

### Structure of the repository
The repository is structured as follows:
> Each folder contains a `README.md` file with the instructions for the corresponding practical experience.
- `tp1-agentes-resolucion-problemas/`: contains the code for the first practical experience, which consists of the implementation of a problem resolution agent.
- `tp2-conocimiento-incertidumbre/`: contains the code for the second practical experience, which consists of the implementation of a knowledge and uncertainty agent.

- `tp3-aprendizaje/`: contains the code for the third practical experience, which consists of the implementation of a learning agent.
:construction: **Not implemented yet.**

- `tp4-optimizacion-aplicaciones/`: contains the code for the fourth practical experience, which consists of the implementation of an optimization agent.
:construction: **Not implemented yet.**

### How to run the code
Each folder contains a `README.md` file with the instructions for the corresponding practical experience.
